title: Finding time
subTitle: I do at times enjoy writing the odd philosophical piece about topics that we don't fully understand or have answers to. In this case, I ponder time and who really owns our moments in time.

Time is precious. Time is confusing. Time is good. Time is refreshing. Time is frustrating. Time is never enough. Time can sometimes be too much. Time is arbitrary. Time is infinite yet so finite. 

Finding time to write this blog has been on my mind a lot recently. I find time to chuck stuff up on Facebook. Yet I struggled to find old photos because they weren’t on, well, Facebook! I also scoured old hard drives for what I was trying to find and it is actually a lot harder than flicking through dusty old albums. Yes really! In our continual attempt to simplify our lives, we build up the levels of complexity we need to blunder through in order to find one single thing. I may have no room to talk being a technologist but I think people like me are more acutely aware of this. 

My point here is there needs to be a place for permanence. I worry we place too much trust in the big names of social media and other means of photo sharing such as Flickr, Google Photos and many more. Yet history teaches us that none of them can live forever because as they grow bigger, the more brittle they become. I draw parallels between them and the ancient civilisations of man whom grew so powerful that they could go no further other than to eventually, well, crumble. 

Many years down the line what will become of those zillions of photos we’ve entrusted the Demi/gods of technology with? Historians and archaeologists of the future won’t be digging in fields but perhaps digging for data in labs crammed full of ancient hard drives and server blades. Perhaps they will be looking for the data we thought we’d deleted but find it is still there, a jumble of old data bones?

So where should we keep those little moments in time of ours? Those precious slices of how we’ve spent our own time on this earth?

It’s a difficult question to answer and one I ponder often. I’ve just never really had the time to solve it. I’m too busy working for and with those big corporations that we’ve unwittingly been absorbed by. 

Ultimately, who owns our time? Them or us? You decide and choose wisely.
