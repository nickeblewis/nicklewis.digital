I have been having some problems with the Facebook Comment plugin today. Most of the time when writing a comment below and submitting it, I would see an error message appear stating:

**"Indicates that a URL property has whitespace characters, which is not allowed."**

This appears as a dialog box within the iframe that contains the comment plugin by Facebook. I am baffled by it because sometimes it comes up and on other occasions it doesn't. It may have something to do with HTTPS because that is one thing that I have intoduced recently. However I can't for the life of me understand why that would be the cause if it was.

So may I ask you to do me a little favour? Please try and comment below and let me know if you see the error? Naturally if you do, you probably won't be able to tell me this via the comments of course. So if that is the case, please send a message to me via the [contact page](/contact) instead.

If anyone out there knows what this message relates to and how to fix this, please definitely contact me!
