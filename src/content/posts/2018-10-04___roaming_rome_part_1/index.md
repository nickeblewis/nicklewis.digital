Capital cities are fascinating places, they have their landmarks, their popular cultural highlights, hustle, bustle, heat, action, imagery, fashion, beauty, food, vibe, humour and their dark sides too. So when we visited Rome for a week recently, we kind of did our own thing. Sure enough the guide book was handy but I seldom found myself looking all that much at it. Tina and I prefer to let our eyes, noses, ears, mind and soul lead us. Rome has kind of infected me in a good way, going through the massive number of images we both captured, there has got to be more to see when we go next time.

I am going to kick off with a bunch of street images in this blog post. Yes I have got photos of the Colloseum, The Pantheon, plenty in fact but as a photographer, I plead to be different, it is all part of the challenge that I relish so, so much.

I can recall when I purchased the Sony Alpha earlier this Summer, I was looking forward to using it in Rome, for a friends wedding when we returned (though I wasn't the official photographer this time round) and for a helicopter flight last weekend. Yep, all of those things I knew it would be great for and by jove, it has not failed to impress. The lightning fast auto-focus has proved to be reliable and the colour handling of the sensor has really pleased me. I nail my shots far better and spend less time on them in post-production. It is a real keeper of a camera. 

I have so much to share and bring to the pages of this site, should keep me quiet for some time and hopefully you the reader engaged!

Well, you have to look out for those vehicle parked against a worn out old wall kindof shots don't you? The travel industry love them and I surely will put these all up on Alamy when I get the chance to do so. We had just found Campo de Fiori, the famous market square and I've got photos of that to share at a later point.

We had some rain the night before so Rome was nicely saturated on this morning as we walked down towards the centre of the City. I loved this street, it was a bit windy and held loads of interest along the way. I have always loved the Piaggio Ape vans and first came across them down in the South of Italy over a decade ago when we first visited Sorrento.

Converted this image in Lightroom CC to Adobe Monochrome and that was it, no other manipulations of the shot at all. I think this is a prime example of using AFS-S on the Sony, picking the focus point, in this case the shop front and then I waited for passers by and I really wanted a scooter! The focus didn't get mixed up, it held on and I am happy with the overall balance that it delivered.
