I used to take a morning walk each day until recently when the weather has been so nasty. We have a glorious day today and I 
managed to get out for a walk first thing before starting work. I hope to do this every day to be honest and at the same 
time capture some photographs of whatever I come across whilst out and about.

The walk took me around [Southwood Woodland](http://www.rushmoor.gov.uk/article/3102/Southwood-Woodland) and it's a good place to go walking or cycling because the paths are all covered with a 
layer of gravel underfoot.
