title: Bewl Water
subTitle: We visited Kent back in April and chose the best week for it because the weather was incredible and on the day we visited Bewl Water it was at least 29 degrees celcius. Sent the Mavic Pro up to see what it looks like from 350 feet up in the sky!

Possibly one of my favourite little films so far. Hope you enjoy this video as much as I did making it!
