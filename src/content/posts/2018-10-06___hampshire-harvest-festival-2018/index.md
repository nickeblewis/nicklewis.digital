It's a wet, cold and utterly autumnal afternoon but we didn't want to let that stop us and we knew that the Hampshire Harvest Festival is on this weekend, so we hopped in the car and drove down there. Sadly the weather seemed to have put off many people, as there were some good things there, just not an awful lot of people compared to normal.

I tend to use auto ISO mode on my camera and generally shoot in aperture priority. So it has been interesting to see how my ISO performs, as today it varied quite dramatically but the end results are none the worse off for it. The above shot could have been shot in ISO 100 for all I know, it remains crisp and well detailed.

Sounds like I am writing a camera review but I'm not lol!!

Here are a few of the shots I took whilst we dodged the heavy rain showers. The whole event was situated around the Cathedral with a dozen stalls or so.

Many of the images here have had very little post production applied to them but in this case I did use a Lightroom profile on some of the images to boost them a tiny bit,not really necessary but I fancied trying it out. If anyone is interested, I may write some articles on my tecnhiques.

I used a radial brush on the eyes of the owl because of the low light, they seemed underexposed but were the sharpest point. A little boost made all the difference in LR.

What kind of camera strap do you prefer? I am not a fan of the regular straps you get with your camera, though there is nothing wrong with my Sony strap but I tend to find no matter what, they get in the way and I never wear my camera around my neck. I tend to scrunch up the normal strap around my wrist which is never ideal. So I decided to pop into the London Camera Exchange shop in Winchester and picked up one of these.

The wrist strap is made of a strong neoprene style material which is adjustable and can be quickly released from the camera when not needed. It cost just a tenner. I used it today and I feel a lot more comfortable using it.
