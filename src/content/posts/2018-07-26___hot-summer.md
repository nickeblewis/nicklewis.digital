I quite literally have very little idea when we last had rain, proper rain that is and with temperatures hitting the 30s here in sunny England (Hampshire in my case), there seems to be no let up. The forecast often predicting storms but none (around here at least) have presented themselves. In the meantime other parts of the country and Europe have seen some of the worst wild fires in living memory. If you didn't believe in climate change before then perhaps you should think again? We are seeing drastic variatons of weather and there is little doubt that when this dry period ends and that really is "when?" - will we see some of the worst rain we've seen in a long time? I may be sounding pessimistic? You'd be right to think that because we need to change our ways.

This leads me to think that as photographers we have a duty to capture the way things are today, the decisive moment as it were and to tell the story of our times, just as our predecessors always have. We have the power to tell these stories and for me that is what photography should be about. Having said that it's often hard to capture those images for fear of taking risks. I have always admired photographers such as Don McCullin.

I can remember once talking to a photographer whose name I never asked for, he was attending an event in central London hosted by Photoshot/UPPA at the time. He was telling me how he was trained to use a kalashnikov just in case and then they let him go about his business. He didn't say whether he had ever used it.


I like the heat but it doesn't like me
Some years ago I purchased my last camera and it has served me well for some time.
