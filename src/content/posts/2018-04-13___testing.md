I wrote this article with Bear on my iPhone, attached a photo of my wife Tina that I found in my iCloud collection. I then opened this in Bear on the Mac, exported the MD file together with attachments, then copied and pasted that into the content folder for this website....

You know what? It kind of works! It may not be totally automatic as such but I can work on it. Super handy for writing articles using my phone/iPad and with no internet access, such as on a flight or whilst waiting somewhere.
