The staff at RHS Wisley are forever surprising us, every time we go and we go quite often, we see something new. The seasons help of course, things change colour, things die off and then they come back to life. The beauty of nature is amazing in itself but couple that together with a team of people who really know what they are doing and it never ceases to impress. New ideas are introduced every week and some gardens once past their best get tidied up and replaced.

I must confess I've forgotten what was there before, it might have been a rose garden that had reached it's peak but the new tropical section is amazing and to think it is so new, it looks like it's been there forever already.


## The RHS Wisley Gardens

Wisley is a collection of different ideas, inspired by plant genus, countries and other gardening concepts. It is vast and you can easily get lost there, discovering so many inspiring ideas along the way. Now I am not a great gardener by any stretch of the imagination, for me it is more about the visual stimulation that gardens provide. Plants and nature are for me by far one of my favourite subjects when taking photos. Let's face it, this is not a gardening blog, there are some fantastic sites out there for that:

> [The Anxious Gardener](https://theanxiousgardener.com/) - is a fabulous site with great photos and an engaging writing style, not too heavy, easy to read and garner ideas from.

I also apologise for not taking note of the plant names that feature in this article, maybe next time I should carry a notepad with me...

Every time we enter Wisley, we always choose a different route to follow and I think that helps provide fresh views each time we visit. I particularly love this garden with its low level shrubs and geometric shapes. It is inspired by the courtyards of stately homes that span the UK far and wide.

The [Surrey Sculpture Society](https://www.surreysculpture.org.uk/) are a regular late summer visitor to the gardens and we saw a number of their exhibits as we wandered. However as you shall see in the next section of this article, the new [Exotic Gardens](https://www.rhs.org.uk/gardens/wisley/garden-highlights/the-exotic-garden) really distracted us! We will have to go back soon to explore the sculptures fully!

Sometimes there is a need for unusual angles! I made use of the screen on the back of my camera that can be angled and pointed the lens upwards from underneath the flower. The sky was very bland but worked well as a giant diffuser. I think the end result is rather pleasing with a sort of Japanese painting aesthetic.

I was really pleased with this shot and not just the final image itself but the way the auto focus behaves. My old Nikon system would have struggled with this, getting confused with the flowing water droplets and the body of the fountain. The Sony however, I was able to select my focus area and keep it in focus whilst adjusting the composition for the exposure. I also find the level indicator in the viewfinder very useful for straightening shots and taking charge of their symmetery.

Now this is a "happy accident", I thought I had focus on the shot, took it and then reviewed via the viewfinder, which I love doing mainly because none of my other cameras would allow for this and it reminds me of looking at slides through a backlit loupe back in the day! I decided to keep this out of focus image because it is quite pretty!

## Enter the Tropics

I got lost in this garden and was picking out so many compositions, I could have taken thousands of different images if I was left there for a day. There were a pleasing mix of Tree Ferns, Banana plants, Lilies and so many others I'd never heard of before.

Up until now most of the exotic plants could only really be seen in the Glass House, so it is nice to see some out in the open air that can survive our climate. Perhaps an indication of how our climate has changed but then temperate climes are what many of these plants thrive upon.

Thankfully the sculptures will be there for quite a few more weeks, so we shall go back to see them!

## Camera kit

I could not finish off this blog post without singing the praises of my new camera, the Sony A7R3 and maybe I should write a post about why I switched? I still have my Nikon gear mind you, I will not part with it, as it has all been part of my journey as a photographer. However the Sony is packed with innovation and the all important images are well worth the price tag. The dynamic range is huge, you can crop down and lose no detail thanks to the 42MP sensor and the colour is as close to reality as any sensor output I've ever seen. I find myself having to carry out less manipulation on Raw files apart from just a little bit of creative work here and there. It works nicely with the Adobe RBG colourspace, especially if like me you use their products for post production. 

The camera is not easy to get used to though, there are features tucked away and you have to discover them, which takes time. The other day I discovered the very clever eye focussing system, I had no idea where it was and this led me to some very useful YouTube videos dedicated to helping you get your head around the complex Sony menu system. So I guess this is part criticism and part, well, forgiveness of the fact there are gems tobe discovered in the menu system!! 

Thanksfully the camera's highly customiseable button system is a saving grace. I for exmple have redfeined the behaviour of some buttons to make the camera work the way I want it to and I suspect this is something I will be tweaking for awhile until 100% happy. That is not to say I am not happy, I love this camera but it is one of those tricky relationships that grows on you over time!

It is a bit like using Linux versus Mac OS, one requires a little more expertise than the other!

You should should see the manual that comes with the camera, it is huge, keep it safe somewhere, as I will dip into mine from time to time.

Anyway some good topics to write about here!
